Alkalima provides a forum for conscientious students to illuminate topics that are often overlooked, yet are important to both student groups and the campus community as a whole at UC Irvine. Essentially, Alkalima represents a new kind of force guided by principles of Islamic morality, justice, equality, and social responsibility that we hope to create and inspire within the context of a sometimes politically passive and socially indifferent campus environment.  The kind of magazine we aim to produce is unique not only in its content, but in its vision. We strive to shift from the stereotypical, apathetic, and insular college experience, and instead move towards gaining a deeper understanding of not only community and domestic issues, but also of international topics as well. By questioning societal norms and expectations, we make it Alkalima's goal to bring back serious intellectual dialogue about the critical issues that students find important, necessary, and impactful.  As Allah calls upon us in the Qur'an, \"O you who believe! Stand out firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though it be against yourselves, or your parents, or your kin, be he rich or poor, Allah is a Better Protector to both (than you). So follow not the lusts (of your hearts), lest you may avoid justice, and if you distort your witness or refuse to give it, verily, Allah is Ever Well-Acquainted with what you do\\\" (4:135), we at Alkalima seek to embody this verse through our publication, and in our daily lives.

In recent years, an activist conservative legal movement has gained influence eroding these enduring values, treating the Constitution as frozen in history, and presenting the law as a series of sterile abstractions.   This new orthodoxy, which threatens to dominate our courts and our laws, does a grave injustice to the American vision.   The American Constitution Society embraces the progress our nation has made toward full embodiment of the Constitution's core values.  ACS believes that law can and should be a force for improving the lives of all people.  We are revitalizing and transforming legal and policy debates in classrooms, courtrooms, legislatures and the media, and we are building a diverse and dynamic network of progressives committed to justice.

Since patients are most likely to match with someone who shares their ethnic background, Be The Match is looking for more diverse donors to join the registry to up the odds of finding a cure for all patients and provide equal outcomes for all.BTMUCI is among the 100+ student groups at colleges and universities across the U.S. who are working to educate peers and add committed, diverse donors to the Be The Match registry to improve the lives of patients and families and improve access to life-saving treatment for historically underserved patients. Every year, approximately 12,000 patients look for someone outside of their family as the best or only hope for a life-saving transplant. Our mission is to engage students in the Be The Match mission to save lives by:1) Providing meaningful, unique opportunities for students to learn about blood cancers and other life-threatening diseases treated by a blood stem cell transplant.2) Increasing awareness of the need for young, committed, racially and ethnically diverse registry members who can save a life.3) Holding campus-wide education/awareness events, donor registry and fundraising events and activities to give the entire student body the opportunity to join in this social movement and global effort.*Chapter members participating in these volunteering opportunities can obtain registered community service hours offered by Be The Match.

However, hardly does a school organization exist here at UCI to support all the Bio Sci international students. Further, as newcomers, it is already difficult enough for international students to fit themselves into a new culture, let alone to ask them to succeed academically or even professionally. It is also due to the fact that not much accessible resources and opportunities are out there for them to take advantage of. This is why we are so eager to create BISA, BioSci International Student Association, aiming to assist Bio Sci international students to better prepare for future in terms of academics and careers, and most importantly, to motivate them to chase their dreams. Although BISA is found primarily to help international students majoring in BioSci, we welcome all UCI students to join. This club will be run through implementing a series of events. These events include, but not limited to BioSci-pertinent workshops; seniors' panelist; alumni homecoming; faculty guest speakers and so forth.

However, we regularly volunteer for habitat restoration projects, like Second Sundays, various marathons and runs, community-wide food drives, and even animal-related service events, on top of any other events that need help in the area.  Our organization strives towards membership development and community outreach by organizing and hosting fundraising events for the following district-wide initiatives: Kiwanis Family House, Pediatric Trauma Program, and American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.

Academic and public views about climate change diverge greatly when comparing university lectures with mainstream websites, media coverage, and political leaders. Climatepedia will make climate information more accessible and transparent.  As a result of conflicting information available to the public, little progress has been made toward a comprehensive legislative solution. Therefore, we hope to educate readers about current academic climate change research to supplement the widely publicized information from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates work together in our department to push vocabularies, to create new conceptual frames of reference, and to construct different genealogies. Psychoanalysis, phenomenology, subaltern studies, feminism and queer studies, materialism, critical race theory, de/post/neo/and X-coloniality, globalectics: these are a few of the analytic frames that inform our work. Translation broadly applied enables us to make moves: across languages, media, geographic borders, and political visions.

IMED is a community service project organization which hosts a variety of events both locally and internationally. Our main current projects are: the Health Smart Project (health education in after school programs), the Orphanage Project (hosted primarily in Tijuana, Mexico), the Mentorship Project (healthcare physicians mentoring), the Outreach Project and the Global Actions Project (medical mission abroad). Health Smart allows our members to go to local after school programs to educate youth of various ages about staying healthy and proactive about their well-being. Orphanage Project works closely with an orphanage in Tijuana, Mexico where we spend a day with the children to teach them about health measures and science materials. The Outreach Project works with a nonprofit organization called Spirit League to help kids with disabilities to play sports; this project also works with Los Alamitos Lestonnac Free Clinic to allow members to gain regular volunteer hours and help an underserved community. Global Actions gives members an opportunity to travel around the world to learn about other culture's medical practices, volunteer at clinics in the Dominican Republic, Peru, India, Panama, Philippines and many other countries. Mentorship is a chance for members to gain one on one interaction with health professionals of their choice and gain valuable insight into the life of a health professional. Along with these five  projects, IMED brings out special guest speakers throughout the year to learn about all the different possibilities of careers in the health care field.

The degree will be of value to those seeking to extend their knowledge and develop their professional expertise; those seeking preparation to enter the teaching profession (including at the community college level); and to those seeking training in critical thinking and communication skills, whether for application in professions other than teaching, as preparation for further graduate studies in the field, or simply out of intellectual curiosity.The program's curriculum reflects UC Irvine's strengths in literary history and criticism, composition and rhetoric, and literary journalism.  Master of English students work closely with the same faculty who teach in our nationally ranked English Ph.D. program, take seminars dedicated exclusively to them, and receive the same MA degree as the department's full-time graduate students, with the exception that foreign language proficiency is not required for the terminal degree.We assume that many students in the program will have full-time employment, and the program is thus optimally designed for part-time enrollment.

Since then, the club has evolved and now has members from all over the world, using the aloha spirit and interest in the Hawaiian and Polynesian culture as a common bond.

LGBTQIA+ communities experience unique challenges to attaining access to justice and inclusion in the legal industry. Many LGBTQIA+ clients lack access to competent representation. They face unfriendly legal precedent, attacks from legislatures, and disparate enforcement.

Community Empowerment: OutLaw provides networking, social, and leadership opportunities for LGBTQIA+ students, faculty, staff, and alumni. We support and empower each other to become stronger advocates and legal professionals by holding space for LGBTQIA+ members of the UCI Law community. Please contact receive updates about upcoming events.  Activism: OutLaw connects UCI Law community members with opportunities to advocate for the safety, inclusion, and equality of people of all sexual orientations and gender identities.

The development of this platform serves as a means to study how an ad-hoc network can relay state information of other vehicles to supplement its own sensor suite. By doing this we hope that the use of onboard sensors can be minimized which will help conserve power usage over time. An ad-hoc network is used to communicate using Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) in a 802.11b/g/n network. The work accomplished on the project was the development of PID steering and speed controllers, an ad-hoc network infrastructure, development of a middleware infrastructure for peripherals, multiple testbed vehicles, and a functioning Lidar localization system. The final results of the current system is that it is able to track the leading vehicle with the lidar and control system and we have a simple \u201cblind imitation\u201d that mimics the lead vehicle's actions, however the smart network that incorporates both lidar and aspects of the blind imitation still requires testing.",

More than this, we hope to contribute to the growing narrative medicine conversation through our work. We encourage you\u2013our club members, fellow students, or curious readers\u2013to join in the conversation by submitting your own work or simply providing commentary on what we feature.

These friendships are strengthened by different social activities such as bonfires, midnight fast food runs, and retreats. Tomo No Kai has also participated in events sponsored by various Nikkei clubs from other schools and throughout the UCI campus. Besides social participation, Tomo also promotes cultural awareness through annual events such as our Mammoth/Manzanar retreat and Cultural Night. Tomo No Kai also holds an annual Day of Remembrance program which commemorates and educates future generations about internment of the Japanese-Americans during World War II. At Tomos general meetings, guest speakers are occasionally invited to speak about significant issues pertaining to the Japanese American community. Members are also encouraged to attend JA conferences such as the JACL Youth Conference. Tomo's dedication to promoting cultural awareness is enhanced by their sister organization Jodaiko (UCI's taiko group), who exemplifies the performance art that is Japanese taiko. Tomo No Kai is the Japanese/Japanese American organization on UC Irvine's campus. It is a place where people can go to make new friends, hang out, serve the community, and participate in many more activities. Japanese culture is a large focus of our organization, and throughout each school year, we have various events that aim to enrich our members with Japanese-American culture. Some of our biggest events during the year are Ballin' at the ARC (basketball tournament), Day of Remembrance (in honor of those interned), Cultural Night (a time to celebrate the beauty of Japanese culture), and our annual Mammoth/Manzanar Trip which gives Tomo No Kai's members a first-hand look at an internment camp.
